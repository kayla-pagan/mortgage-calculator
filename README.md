# Mortgage Calculator

I am currently working on this fun mortgage calculator project. As I progress through the project,
I will update this file with information. 

Fun fact: I am currently a Mortgage Loan Originator, so I really want to make something useful
for my profession since many ask me what payments would generally look like for a house of certain value.
This is a great way to do some quick calculations on the spot.
